This is a little service that runs periodically to give strava kudos to people you follow.

## Instalation

To run the service only once:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/drio/stravaKudos.git
$ cd stravaKudos
# NOTE: Depending on your installation, you will have to install tons of dependency libraries.
# If you get a refine list for your apt-get command, please share it with me so I can add it to 
# my makefile and other users will benefit from it.
$ npm i
$ EMAIL=foo@bar.com PASSWORD=foobar make 

```

Where EMAIL and PASSWORD contain your strava credentials.

If all that works, you can then install it as a service in a linux box (tested
on ubuntu 20.04):

```
$ cd stravaKudos
$  EMAIL=foo@bar.com PASSWORD=foobar make service/install
$  EMAIL=foo@bar.com PASSWORD=foobar make service/start
```

Make sure the software runs correctly as a service. Then if you want to start it
at boot time:

```
$  EMAIL=foo@bar.com PASSWORD=foobar make service/start_at_boot
```

Notice the service will run every 15 minutes. If you want to change that, update line number 4 in the
`stravaKudos.sh.template` file.

When running as a service, you can check the output with:

```
$ EMAIL=foo@bar.com PASSWORD=foobar make service/logs
